# World Hyper Fuzzy Deep Learning
# A Non-Invasive Method for Gastric Cancer Feature Selection and Prediction based on Metabolomics Data

1 - First, download WHH Feature Selection.zip, unzip it, and run the file in the feature_selection notebook to get the selected feature data.

2 - Then download ML Models.zip, unzip it, and paste the output from step 1 into it. Then run Gastric Cancer Prediction Experimental evaluation.ipynb for each algorithm.

### note:
- Remember, to read the csv, you need to change the file name to Gastric Cancer Prediction Experimental evaluation.ipynb.
Note that the values ​​of the interpretability criteria change each time you run and output.
- By nature, the values ​​should change and the model should remain stable and interpretable. So don't be surprised if the graphs change.
